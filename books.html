                <h1>BOOKS</h1>
                <p>Before I went to high school, I was reading 1-2 books a day. I spent my days and nights at the public or school libraries. I slept very little, since bedtimes were never enforced, and every night was "just one more chapter" after "just one more chapter". Afterwards, I found myself engrossed in other pursuits but always rediscovered my love for reading whenever a teacher assigned a novel for the semester, and I managed to finish it within a night or two. (My favorites, among those, are The Scarlet Letter and Of Mice and Men.) I don't care to list all the books I've ever read here (since it's impossible at best) but instead will keep a record of all the books I shall henceforth read.</p>
