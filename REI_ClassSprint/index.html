            <h3>Rediscover Your Friends</h3>
            <p>This year, REI will shut down on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday because fundamentally we believe that being outside makes us our best selves – healthier and happier, physically and mentally.</p>

            <h3>WILL YOU GO OUT <br>WITH US?</h3>
            <p>REI is committed to helping people tap into the joy, renewal and connection that comes from spending time outside with friends and family. This year, we are again closing our doors on Black Friday and paying our 12,000+ employees to spend time outdoors. </p>

            <h3>Start Your Next Adventure</h3>
            <p>And we’ve asked our nonprofit partners, government agencies and a short list of companies who care deeply for the outdoors to join us. These amazing organizations are listed below, and we’re grateful to say the list is growing every day.</p>
